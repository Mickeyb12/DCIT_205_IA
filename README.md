Welcome to the documentation for the Department Website project. This website serves as a centralized platform for our department, providing essential information, resources, and updates. As a student, I have developed this website to enhance communication and facilitate easy access to department-related content.
# Purpose of website
The primary goal of this website is to create a user-friendly interface for students, faculty, and staff to access information related to courses, events, and announcements within the department. It also aims to showcase the achievements of our department and create a sense of community among its members.
